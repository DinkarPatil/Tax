"""FastAPI entrypoint.

Run locally:
    uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000

The lifespan hook handles DB bootstrap before the first request: if no SQLite file
exists at the configured path, the migration runner creates and populates it; if it
exists, only pending migrations are applied.
